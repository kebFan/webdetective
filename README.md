Then in there you can see a list of output, the very first one would be either Clean website or malicious website; this is the Google API we are using to develop our future goal
There is a number in the list and that number is the Apility API which is what we will be using to implement our rating for the website
A value of 0 or more is a good website and less means more malicious
