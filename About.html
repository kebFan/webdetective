      There are many suspicious domains on the internet. In an effort to identify them, as well as false
      positives, we have assembled weighted lists based on tracking and malware lists from different sources
      The goal of web detective is to accept a URL from a user that wants to check
      the vulnerabilities of "THEIR OWN" or an "AUTHORIZED" website.
